    "When purchasing a Life Insurance plan, it is important to remember that its main purpose is to replace an income that is lost in case of the unfortunate demise of the chief bread winner of the family (Life Assured). A child rarely has an income and therefore has no reason to be insured. If the Insurance Plan is taken in name of the child, the plan gets derailed in case of the unfortunate demise of the parent. Thus, the very objective of any ChildrenÃ¢â¬â¢s Plan is undermined if the plan is acquired in the childÃ¢â¬â¢s name. Therefore, as far as possible, make sure that you, as a parent, are the Life Assured and the nominee or the beneficiary is your child."

If the medical insurance premium has been paid for oneÃ¢â¬â¢s parents, an additional deduction of Rs. 15,000 can be claimed under section 80D every year. If oneÃ¢â¬â¢s parents are Senior Citizens, an additional amount of Rs. 20,000 can be claimed. Thus, a policy holder can deduct up to Rs. 35,000 from his taxable income for medical insurance premiums paid. Premiums paid in cash will not qualify for tax benefit.

Payment under fixed benefit plans is usually made upon diagnosis and is not linked to the medical expense that the life insured may incur for treatment of such condition. Such plans help one to compensate for loss of income that arises due to long period of treatment and recuperation that may be required. Such policies pay the benefits only once and then the cover ceases. Reimbursement plans provide for reimbursement of actual medical expenses incurred in a hospital. These medical expenses could range from low amounts incurred in treatment of common ailments like malaria or dengue to significant expenses incurred in treatment of critical illnesses. Such policies do not cease on payment of claim once and continue to pay the claims every year subject to continuous renewals. View more"

Your policy will be discontinued if: You do not exercise any of the above-mentioned options, or You choose to completely withdraw from the policy without any risk cover. Until the discontinuance of the policy, the risk cover will remain in-force, and policy charges will continue to be deducted. Once the policy is discontinued, the risk cover will cease, and the fund value (as on the date of discontinuance) less the applicable Discontinuance Charge (Please see the Charges section for details of the Discontinuance Charges) will be moved to the 'Discontinued Policy Fund'. The minimum guaranteed interest rate applicable to the 'Discontinued Policy Fund' shall be 4% p.a. Such rate may be changed in the future if the IRDA revises the minimum rate for discontinued policies. The Discontinued Policy Fund (SFIN: ULIF05110/03/11DiscontdPF101) shall be a unit fund that will invest 100% of assets in Government Securities and/or Money Market Instruments. Any excess income earned in the discontinued fund over and above the minimum guaranteed interest rate shall also be apportioned to the 'Discontinued Policy Fund'. A Fund Management Charge of 0.50% p.a. will be levied for amounts in the 'Discontinued Policy Fund'. If a discontinued policy is not revived, the proceeds will be paid out upon the completion of the lock-in period of five years. In instances where the revival period is not completed at the end of the lock-in period, the policyholder can opt to receive the proceeds either upon the completion of the lock-in period or upon the completion of the revival period. If, in such cases, the policyholder does not exercise any option, then the proceeds will be paid upon the completion of the lock-in period.
